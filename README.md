Whenever we work related to any NLP project something related to  text , then we try to convert words into embeddings or vectors .
These vectors are very huge vectors, you can store them in your local machine . You require database to store them . Specically related to embeddings , vector db is very much benifical because you can apply some of the important algorithm like similarity search and some other algorithm related to text . just querying it from the database and getting the output .
